        <h2>Description</h2>
        A beautiful <strong>Scandinavian</strong> 1970's 
        blue 'hooped' glass vase with white interior casing. 
        Most likely made by one of the Swedish makers such as <stong>Lindshammar</stong> 
        or <strong>Ryd</strong>, but I have not seen this particular design 
        before with a label.

        by 5.5 inches in diameter at widest point.

        <h2>Condition</h2>
        Excellent condition, no chips or cracks.
